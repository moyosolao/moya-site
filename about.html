          <h1>Heyyy!</h1>
          <p>
            I’m Moya, and this is my blog/personal website ◡̈ *Virtual Hug* <br><br>

            I coded this space to showcase my work across all facets of my life-both the creative and the technical. I’ve always had a love for creation and found watching an idea unfold step by step into something real and new really really beautiful. I love to understand-not just in the classroom but everywhere. I’m always picking up new skills, exploring new corners of curiosity, and collecting passions like they’re Pokémon. I even like to coin myself a Renaissance WOman. 
            This appreciation for design and storytelling has lead me to study Software Engineering and Visual Arts & Technology, while also pursuing fashion modeling and styling. That said, when it comes to my personal pursuits, I like to keep that list ever-growing. I love the phrase “The world is your oyster”- though to be honest I never really eat them. But metaphorically? I’m slurping up every opportunity I can find. <br><br>

            I hope these parts of me I share gives you a window into the way I see, build, and play with the world around me. Thx for being here ◡̈ <br><br>
            Xx, Moya
